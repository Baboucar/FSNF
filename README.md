# Enhancing neural collaborative filtering using Hybrid Feature selection
- This is a Pytorch implementation of the paper our proposed recommender model
- the datasets for our models and baselines are located in HSFR/data folder 
- baselines are in baselines.zip



### Environment Settings:

```
* python==3.8
* pytorch== 1.110
* numpy == 1.22.4 
```

### Example to run:
```
to run the CNN-Base and CNN-Base+HSFR model, run the main.py in HSFR/main.py
to run the CNN-Base+HSFM+GMF model, run  the  main_gmf.py in HSFR/main+gmf.py
```
